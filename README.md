The Juno docs describe the Juno open source project, a blockchain built for scale.

The network architecture goes on to satisfy all three desirable properties of a proper blockchain: it is scalable, secure and decentralized.

Built using the most widely adopted blockchain framework, the Cosmos SDK and utilizing Tendermint BFT consensus.

**Why Juno?**

Deploy apps thats scale!

Benefit from an open source platform for interoperable smart contracts which automatically executes, controls or documents a procedure of relevant events and actions according to the terms of such contract or agreement to be valid & usable across multiple sovereign networks.

Juno as a sovereign public blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem, aims to provide a sandbox environment for the deployment of such interoperable smart contracts. The network serves as a decentralized, permissionless & censorship resistant avenue for developers to efficiently and securely launch application specific smart contracts using proven frameworks and compile them in various languages Rust & Go with the potential future addition of C and C++ 
Battle tested contract modules such as CosmWasm, allow for decentralized applications (dapps) to be compiled on robust and secure multi-chain smart contracts.
