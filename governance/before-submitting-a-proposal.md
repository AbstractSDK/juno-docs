# Before submitting a proposal

Before submitting a proposal:

* [ ] See on Telegram or Discord what sentiment is like for the motion you would like to propose
* [ ] Go to the #governance channel on Discord to discuss your proposal
* [ ] Check via a block explorer that a similar proposal is not in flight or was discussed recently
* [ ] If the proposal is a parameter change with implications for development or smart contract usage, consider speaking to your friendly neighbourhood core dev
* [ ] If the proposal will result in significant engineering effort to implement, definitely ask a member of the core team about what would happen if the proposal passes

These are just guidelines to think about - obviously, Juno is a community initiative, and what the community proposes and passes will be actioned. The core team does not always know what is best for the project.
