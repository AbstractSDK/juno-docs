# Economic Overview

JunoÂ´s economic system is designed to foster a self-sustaining economy were incentives are aligned to drive security and decentralization of the Juno Network. 

Participants in this economy include developers, validators and delegators.

The network incentive structures is pre-set in the Juno Protocol at genesis but subject to change based on the flexible evolution of the economy. All changes to the structure can be voted in or out by Juno delegators and validators. Not only does the native asset secure the network but gives onchain governance voting rights.

Incentives follow a pre-set game-theory model that has been crafted to strongly incentivize early adopters and gradually decreases as fees generated by p2p transactions and usage of decentralized applications on Juno make up for the decrease over time.  These protocol-based rewards are distributed per epoch across the active delegated stake/validator set. More structural details can be found in the incentive structure tab \(Below the economic overview\).
