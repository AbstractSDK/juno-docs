# Introduction

Jun√∏ is an open source platform for interoperable smart contracts which automatically executes, controls or documents a procedure of relevant events and actions according to the terms of such contract or agreement to be valid & usable across multiple sovereign networks.

Juno as a **sovereign public blockchain** in the Cosmos ecosystem, aims to provide a sandbox environment for the deployment of such interoperable smart contracts. The network serves as a **decentralized, permissionless & censorship resistant** avenue for developers to efficiently and securely launch application specific smart contracts using proven frameworks and compile them in various languages **Rust & Go** with the potential future addition of C and C++ Battle tested contract modules such as CosmWasm, will allow for decentralized applications \(dapps\) to be compiled on robust and secure multi-chain smart contracts. EVM support and additional specialized modules to be introduced after genesis subject to onchain governance.

At the heart of Cosmos is the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol \(IBC\), which sets the table for an interoperable base layer 0 to now be used to transfer data packets across thousands of independent networks supporting IBC. Naturally, the next evolutionary milestone is to enable cross-network smart contracts.

The Juno blockchain is built using the **Cosmos SDK framework**. A generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint BFT. It is based on two major principles: Modularity & capabilities-based security.

Agreement on the network is reached via **Tendermint BFT consensus**.

Tendermint BFT is a solution that packages the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain into a generic engine, allowing developers to focus on application development as opposed to the complex underlying protocol. As a result, Tendermint saves hundreds of hours of development time.

Juno originates from a **community driven initiative**, prompted by developers, validators & delegators in the Cosmos ecosystem. The common vision is to preserve the neutrality, performance & reliability of the Cosmos Hub and offload smart contract deployment to a dedicated sister Hub. Juno plans to make an early connection to the Cosmos Hub enabling IBC transfers, cross-chain smart contracts and making use of shared security.

A decentralized launch of the Juno main-net is enabled by a large set of independent validators from across the blockchain space. $Juno, the native asset has many functions like securing the Juno Hub & serving as a work token to give access to on-chain governance voting rights and to provide utility in the deployment and execution of smart contracts.
