**What is Juno?**

Jun√∏ is an open source platform for **interoperable smart contracts** which automatically executes, controls or documents a procedure of relevant events and actions according to the terms of such contract or agreement to be valid & usable across multiple sovereign networks.

**Why Juno?**

Juno as a **sovereign public blockchain** in the Cosmos ecosystem, aims to provide an environment for the deployment of interoperable smart contracts. The network serves as a **decentralized, permissionless & censorship resistant** avenue for developers to efficiently and securely launch smart contracts using proven frameworks and compile them in various languages **Rust & Go.**

Battle tested contract modules such as **CosmWasm**, allow for **decentralized applications** \(dapps\) to be compiled on robust and secure multi-chain smart contracts. EVM support and additional specialized modules are to be introduced after genesis and are subject to onchain governance.

**IBC**

At the heart of Cosmos ecosystem is the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol \(IBC\), which sets the table for an interoperable base layer 0 to now be used to transfer data packets across thousands of independent networks supporting IBC. Naturally, the next evolutionary milestone is to enable cross-network smart contracts.

**Cosmos SDK**

The Juno blockchain is built using the **Cosmos SDK framework**. A generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint BFT. It is based on two major principles: Modularity & capabilities-based security.

**Tendermint**

Agreement on the network is reached via **Tendermint BFT consensus**.

Tendermint BFT is a solution that packages the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain into a generic engine, allowing developers to focus on application development as opposed to the complex underlying protocol. As a result, Tendermint saves hundreds of hours of development time.
