# Origin

Juno originates from a **community driven initiative**, prompted by developers, validators & delegators in the Cosmos ecosystem. A common vision is to **preserve the neutrality, performance & reliability** of the Cosmos Hub and offload smart contract deployment to a dedicated sister Hub.

Furthermore, another key founding principle is to continuously strive towards **decentralization of both the network and native asset**. From the very start this reflects in the approach to the Juno asset distribution. 

On Feb 18th 2021 at 6:00 PM UTC a snapshot of Cosmos Hub-3 was taken as part of the Stargate upgrade. Juno uses this snapshot for its genesis allocation. This means that ATOM holders are in control of the Juno Hub from day 1. All decisions have to go through onchain governance proposals. 

The decentralized launch of the Juno main-net on October 1st 2021 is enabled by a large set of independent network validators from across the blockchain space.
