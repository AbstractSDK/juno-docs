# Origin

Juno originates from a **community driven initiative**, prompted by dozens of developers, validators & delegators in the Cosmos ecosystem. The shared vision is to **preserve the neutrality, performance & reliability** of the Cosmos Hub and offload smart contract deployment to a dedicated sister Hub.

Some of the founding principles center around:

⚪️ Inception of the **worlds first designated interoperable smart contract network**

⚪️ Eliminating common smart contract **L1 bottlenecks** (Scalability, interoperability, high fees, easy of use, concentrated governance control)

⚪️ **Sister Hub to the Cosmos Hub** (Preserving the neutrality of the Hub by offloading smart contract usage/congestion to a designated contract zone)

⚪️ **Governance by ATOM stakers which become JUNO stakers**. Stakedrop where 47% of the genesis supply goes to ATOM stakers on a 1:1 basis.

⚪️ Commitment to utilize** shared security from the Cosmos Hub** once available.

⚪️ **Eliminating potential legal limitations** (Juno has not/will not conduct any form of seed sale, private sale or public sale. All $Juno enter circulation via the decentralized network launch on October 1st 2021)
