# Origin

Juno originates from a **community driven initiative**, prompted by dozens of developers, validators & delegators in the Cosmos ecosystem. The shared vision is to **preserve the neutrality, performance & reliability** of the Cosmos Hub and offload smart contract deployment to a dedicated sister Hub.

Some of the founding principles center around:

⚪️ Inception of the worlds first interoperable smart contract network

⚪️ Eliminating common smart contract L1 bottlenecks \(Scalability, interoperability, high fees, easy of use, concentrated governance control\)

⚪️ Sister Hub to the Cosmos Hub \(Preserving the neutrality of the Hub by offloading smart contract usage/congestion to a designated contract zone\)

⚪️ Governance by ATOM stakers which become JUNO stakers.. 47% of the genesis supply goes to ATOM stakers on a 1:1 basis.

⚪️ Commitment to utilize shared security from the Cosmos Hub once available.
