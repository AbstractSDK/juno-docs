# Origins

Juno as a sovereign public blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem, aims to provide a sandbox environment for the deployment of interoperable smart contracts. The network serves as a decentralized, permissionless & censorship resistant avenue for developers to efficiently and securely launch application specific smart contracts using proven frameworks and compile them in various languages Rust & Go with the potential future addition of C and C++ Battle tested contract modules such as CosmWasm, allow for decentralized applications (dapps) to be compiled on robust and secure multi-chain smart contracts. EVM support and additional specialized modules to be introduced after genesis subject to onchain governance.

The chain is built using the Starport framework and agreement on the network is reached in a decentralized way via Tendermint BFT consensus. An independent set of validators and delegators secure the mainnet via delegated proof of stake.

$Juno, the native asset of the network, serves as a work token to give access to on chain governance, security of the blockchain and to provide utility in the deployment and execution of smart contracts.
