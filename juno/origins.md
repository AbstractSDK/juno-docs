# Origins

**Juno** is a sovereign blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to provide a ready-to-go environment for the deployment of smart contracts. The Cosmos Contracts network serves as a decentralized, permission-less and censorship-resistant path for developers and projects to launch application-specific smart contracts using frameworks such as CosmWasm.

The chain is built using the Starport framework and agreement on the network is reached in a decentralized way via Tendermint BFT consensus. An independent set of validators and delegators secure the mainnet via delegated proof of stake.

$Juno, the native asset of the network, serves as a work token to give access to on chain governance, security of the blockchain and to provide utility in the deployment and execution of smart contracts.
