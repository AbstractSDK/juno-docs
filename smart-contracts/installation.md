# Installation

## Go

You can setup golang following [official documentation \(opens new window\)](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki#working-with-go). The latest versions of `wasmd` require go version `v1.15`.

## Rust

Assuming you have never worked with rust, you will first need to install some tooling. The standard approach is to use `rustup` to maintain dependencies and handle updating multiple versions of `cargo` and `rustc`, which you will be using.

##  Installing Rust in Linux and Mac

First, [install rustup \(opens new window\)](https://rustup.rs/). Once installed, make sure you have the wasm32 target:

```
rustup default stable
cargo version
# If this is lower than 1.49.0+, update
rustup update stable

rustup target list --installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Installing Rust in Windows 10

First, download and execute `rustup-init.exe` from [rustup.rs \(opens new window\)](https://rustup.rs/)or [rust-lang.org \(opens new window\)](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

If requested, manually download and install Visual C++ Build Tools 2019, from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ . Make sure "Windows 10 SDK" and "English language pack" are selected.

Continue running `rustup-init.exe`, and proceed with the installation.

Optionally:

* Download and install [gvim \(opens new window\)](https://www.vim.org/download.php#pc), and modify the Env vars to add &lt;gvim folder&gt; to the PATH.
* Download and install [git for windows \(opens new window\)](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Modify the Env vars to add &lt;git folder&gt;\bin to PATH.
* Turn on Developer Mode \(Settings -&gt; Update and Security: For Developers\) and enable Device Discovery, to be able to access the Windows 10 server through ssh \(https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/how-to-win10-ssh-service.html\#section-mssshserv-enable\).

Install the wasm32 target:Copy

```bash
rustup default stable
cargo version
# If this is lower than 1.49.0, update
rustup update stable

rustup target list --installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

For those new to rust, the `stable` channel comes out every 6 weeks with a stable release \(as of 2020-08-03 it is 1.45.2 - we support 1.44.1+\). The `nightly` channel is the bleeding edge and not only is it a version or two ahead \(for testing\), but it allows some extra unstable features, whose APIs may change. For compiling `wasm`, you will want to use `stable`. We use `nightly` to compile the runtime for `wasmd`, which needs it for the singlepass compiler with gas metering and more.

## wasmd

`wasmd` is the backbone of CosmWasm platform. It is the implementation of a Cosmoszone with wasm smart contracts enabled.

This code was forked from the `cosmos/gaia` repository as a basis and then added x/wasm and cleaned up many gaia-specific files. However, the wasmd binary should function just like gaiad except for the addition of the x/wasm module.

If you intend to develop or edit a contract, you need wasmd.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd.git
cd wasmd
# replace the v0.15.1 with the most stable version on https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/releases
git checkout v0.15.1
make install

# verify the installation
wasmd version
```

â“˜ If you have any problems here, check your `PATH`. `make install` will copy `wasmd` to `$HOME/go/bin` by default, please make sure that is set up in your `PATH` as well, which should be the case in general for building Go code from source.

## Using Juno Testnets 

Testing network [https://github.com/CosmosContracts/Juno](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/Juno) is launched to save you of the hassle of running a local network and speed up your development.

Use go 1.15 for compiling`junod`executable

```bash
# clone wasmd repo
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd.git && cd wasmd

git checkout v0.16.0

# build wasmd executable
make install

```

## Setting up your IDE

We will need a good editor to guide us through the experience. We highly recommend plugins that help you learn syntax, especially when just starting rust. There are two free editor environments we recommend, choose the one that is more familiar to you.

If you use VSCode \([Download link \(opens new window\)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)\) you just need to add the rust plugin. This is the best supported environment for RLS \(Rust Language Server\) and uses the rust compiler to type-check all your code on save. This gives the same error messages as the actual compiler would and highlights along the line of the code, but it can be a bit slow to respond sometime \(as it runs the compiler\). It is quite good, and if you are used to VSCode, I highly recommend it:

[RLS for VSCode\(opens new window\)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust)

The other option I can recommend it Intellij IDEA Community Edition \([Download link \(opens new window\)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)\), along with the Rust Plugin. This has very nice and quick support for many language features directly inline. In particular, it shows the inferred types along variables, which can be very helpful, especially when working with \(nested\) generics. It catches most syntax errors very quickly, but not all of them. Which means sometimes you have to look at the compile failures to find the errors. If you are coming from another Intellij product \(eg. Goland\), I recommend this approach:

[RUST for Intellij\(opens new window\)](https://intellij-rust.github.io/)

There are many more editors out there and some have varying degrees of rust support, at least syntax highlighting, but I would recommend trying one of the two above, especially if you are new to rust. Once you are confident in the language, you can always use another editor and customize it to your liking.

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
