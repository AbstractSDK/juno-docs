### Create new account

1. After clicking on the **Create new account** button you will be presented with a a "mnemonic seed" as well as fields for your "Account name", "New Password" and "Confirm password".

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Before continuing:** Write down your "Mnemonic Seed" on a piece of paper. Store these words in a secure place and **NEVER** provide them to anyone. This phrase is the only way to recover your account if you lose access to the Keplr extension and it is the **ONLY** way to migrate you account to another wallet. Anyone who has this Mnemonic Seed can access and withdraw your crypto tokens.

**DO NOT:** Take screenshots or store these words digitally.
